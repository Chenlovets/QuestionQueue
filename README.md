# CMU-17637 Web Apps final project - Team QQ

## Why

The inspiration of our app QuestionQueue comes from our study experience in CMU. We found there exists a bidirectional communication difficulty between professors and students in CMU class, which typically happens in a large lecture room with hundreds of students attending. Very often, professors cannot hear the voice of students sitting at the corner or the back of the classroom. Also, as students, we all have experienced that our fellow classmates sitting very far away asked questions or give answers to a question, but we cannot hear anything at all. It can get really annoying sometimes because without knowing what they have asked, we cannot fully understand what the professor is trying to explain. 

Therefore, our QuestionQueue will try to solve this problem to improve both the professors’ teaching experience and the students’ learning experience at CMU. 

## What

QuestionQueue will bring the following main functionalities (for now) to the CMU classroom:

1. Send questions to the queue in real time, which will be clearly displayed to the entire class.
2. Students can “Like” a question to jump the queue if they have the same confusions about it.
3. Questions will be sorted and displayed by the number of likes so that professor can answer the most concerned questions during limited lecture time.
4. All questions asked and discussed during lecture will be saved so that students can refer when needed.
5. Question leaderboard and Bonus point mechanism.
